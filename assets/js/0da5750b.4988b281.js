Unlike a Set, we can't get members back out of the Bloom Filter, but we can test if something is already in there or not... with some false positives due to hash collisions. When asked if something is a member of a Set, the Bloom Filter can tell us \"no it isn't\", or \"it's likely that it is\"."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"This hashing approach sacrifices the 100% accuracy we'd get with a Set to dramatically reduce the memory overhead.
