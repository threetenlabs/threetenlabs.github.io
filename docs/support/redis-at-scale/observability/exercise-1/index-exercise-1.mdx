Clone this repo if you have not already: [https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru301](https://github.com/redislabs-training/ru301)

Change into the `observability-stats` directory.

<strong>Requirements</strong>

- docker
- docker-compose
- internet connection

<strong>Starting Environment</strong>

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

<strong>Connect to the Environment</strong>

In a terminal run this command to get a shell prompt inside the running Docker container:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec redis_stats bash
```

<strong>Generate load</strong>

A simple way to to generate some load is to open another terminal and run:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec redis_stats redis-benchmark
```

<strong>Info</strong>

Since most of the stats data comes from the `INFO` command you should first run this to view that there.

```bash
$ redis-cli INFO
```

Try piping this output to a file.

<strong>Memory usage</strong>

Since we generally recommend setting the `maxmemory` size, it is possible to calculate the percentage of memory in use and alert based on results of the `maxmemory` configuration value and the `used_memory` stat.

First set the `maxmemory`.

```bash
$ redis-cli config set maxmemory 100000
```

Then you can pull the two data points to see how that could be used to calculate memory usage.

```bash
$ redis-cli INFO | grep used_memory:
$ redis-cli CONFIG GET maxmemory
```

<strong>Client data</strong>

You can pull the `clients` section of the `INFO` command:

```bash
$ redis-cli info clients
```

or maybe a particular metric you would want to track:

```bash
$ redis-cli info clients | grep connected_clients
```

<strong>Stats section</strong>

Use `redis-cli` to list the full 'stats' section.

<strong>Hit ratio</strong>

A cache hit/miss ratio could be generated using two data points in the stats section.

```bash
$ redis-cli INFO stats | grep keyspace
```

<strong>Evicted keys</strong>

Eviction occurs when Redis has reached its maximum memory and `maxmemory-policy` in `redis.conf` is set to something other than `volatile-lru`.

```bash
$ redis-cli INFO stats | grep evicted_keys
```

<strong>Expired keys</strong>

It is a good idea to keep an eye on the expirations to make sure Redis is performing as expected.

```bash
$ redis-cli INFO stats | grep expired_keys
```

<strong>Keyspace</strong>

The following data could be used for graphing the size of the keyspace as a quick drop or spike in the number of keys is a good indicator of issues.

```bash
$ redis-cli INFO keyspace
```

<strong>Workload (connections received, commands processed)</strong>

The following stats are a good indicator of workload on the Redis server.

```bash
$ redis-cli INFO stats | egrep "^total_"
```
