<p>
  Redis has a client-server architecture and uses a request-response model.
  Applications send requests to the Redis server, which processes them and
  returns responses for each. The role of a Redis client library is to act as an
  intermediary between your application and the Redis server.
</p>

Client libraries perform the following duties:

- Implement the Redis wire protocol - the format used to send requests to and receive responses from the Redis server
- Provide an idiomatic API for using Redis commands from a particular programming language

## Managing the connection to Redis

Redis clients communicate with the Redis server over TCP, using a protocol called [RESP](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/) (REdis Serialization Protocol) designed specifically for Redis.

The RESP protocol is simple and text-based, so it is easily read by humans, as well as machines. A common request/response would look something like this. Note that we're using netcat here to send raw protocol:

This simple, well documented protocol has resulted in Redis clients for almost every language you can think of. The [redis.io](https://redis.io/docs/clients/) client page lists over 200 client libraries for more than 50 programming languages.
