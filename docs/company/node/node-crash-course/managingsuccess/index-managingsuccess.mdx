We launched our checkin application, and it's been an incredible success! Users love it and are checking in to all of the locations that signed up to be part of it!

In the next few modules, we'll look at how Redis can help us manage growth as we gain more users, process more checkins, and increase our usage of external services.

We'll look at:

- Using Redis as a cache in an Express application.
- Scaling horizontally by using Redis as a session store for Express.
- Scaling checkin processing with Redis Streams consumer groups.
- Preventing duplicate checkins using probabilistic data structures.
