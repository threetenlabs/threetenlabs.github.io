Cards have four distinct suits: hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades. There are 13 unique ranks: the king, the queen, the jack, the ten, the 9, the 8, the 7, the 6, the 5, the 4, the 3, the 2, and finally, the ace.  
Each card has a suit and a rank and a deck consists of a complete set of each of the 52 unique cards. This is considerd a standard deck of playing cards. Spider solitaire is played with 2 standard deck of playing cards for a total of 104 cards.

While there are four distinct suits, the game may be played with either 1, 2, or 4 suits.  
The 1-suit level may be referred to as the `easy` level.  
The 2-suit level is often referred as the `intermediate` level.  
The 4-suit level is considered the hardest level, also called the `advanced` level.
The more suits in play, the more difficult the game is to win.

Many players report not winning any games at the 4-suit level.
Most prefer to play at the 2-suit level.
