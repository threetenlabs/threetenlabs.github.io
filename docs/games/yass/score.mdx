### Basic Scoring:

1. **Card Placement:**

   - For each card placed in a foundation pile: +10 points.
   - For each card placed in a tableau pile: +1 point.
   - For each hint used: -2 points.

2. **Suit Multiplier:**

   - One Suit: x1 multiplier
   - Two Suit: x2 multiplier
   - Four Suit: x4 multiplier

3. **Completing a Suit:**
   - One Suit: +100 points
   - Two Suit: +200 points
   - Four Suit: +400 points

### Time Bonuses:

1. **Time Remaining:**

   - Calculate the time remaining after completing the game.
   - Bonus points awarded based on time remaining.

   Example Bonus Points:

   - 0-5 minutes: +500 points
   - 5-10 minutes: +400 points
   - 10-15 minutes: +300 points
   - 15-20 minutes: +200 points

### Hint Penalties:

If hints are used during the game, apply a penalty to the final score. Each hint could subtract a certain number of points (e.g., -50 points per hint).

### Total Score Calculation:

`Total Score` = Card Placement Score + Completing a Suit Score + Time Bonus - Hint Penalties
