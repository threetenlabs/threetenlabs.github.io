Why does it say could not log you into **Game Center**?

You need to be logged into Game Center to play online. The Y.A.S.S will attempt to log you in automatically, however, if you cancel 3 times, it will turn Game Center off for you. You can enable this again by going to your device's Settings -> Game Center -> and enable and logging in there.
