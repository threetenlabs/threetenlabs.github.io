The game is played by using your finger to click and drag a suited run from the bottom of one column and release it either into an empty column or onto the bottom most card in another column.
The suited run may contain as little as 1 card or as many as 12 cards. The player must drag on the topmost card to be moved but is not required to move an entire suited run.
For example, suppose that the `JH, TH, 9H` suited run (of hearts) is bottom most in a column. As long as there is somewhere to move each, the player might move the entire suited run `JH, TH, 9H`, the `TH, 9H` suited run, or just the `9H` suited run.
It's often in the player's best interest to not move the longest suited run possible.

A suited run might only be dropped directly onto a card that extends the suited run; however, the accepting card need not be the same suit as the suited run being moved. For example, a `7S, 6S, 5S, 4S` run (of spades) can only be moved onto an `8`, but the suit of the `8` may or may not be a spade.

When the player either cannot make any more moves or chooses not to, they then click of the pile of face-down cards located in the stock, which causes 10 more cards to be dealt face-up in the tableau, one into each column.  
Play then continues as described above. If after all deals have been dealt to the tableau and the player then fails to win the game, it is considered a loss.

The key objective of the game is to order a full set of all the 13 unique ranks, from the king down to the ace, all of the identical suit. A full set is often referred to as a build and creating such a set as building a suit, building a set, or simple as building. The word completing of assembling may be used instead of building.
So with 104 total cards, 8 builds are possible no matter what the level. When all 8 builds are assembled, no cards remain in the tableau and the game is won. In effect, one could claim that the object of the game is to remove all of the cards from the tableau.

Note that the king, having the highest rank, is the only rank that can never be placed onto another card by the player but might only be moved by placing it into an empty column. But the king, as part of a full set of ranks, is removed from play whenever a build is completed.

The ace, having the lowest rank, is the only rank onto which the player can never place another card. `HOWEVER`, a deal can and will deposit a card onto any ace that is at the bottom of its column at the time of the deal.
