### Layout

![An image from the static](/img/yass/layout.png)

The table can be broken up into three basic areas, the tableau(1), the stock(2), and the foundation(3). While it's not at all necessary to know the names of these areas to play the game, it does make it easier to understand some aspects of the game.

### The tableau

The tableau is the in-play area where most of the action takes place. It's sectioned horizontally into 10 equal-sized unmarked areas called columns, sometimes referred to as slots. Each column is simply an area where a pile of cards is usually situated.

### The stock

The stock is where the undealt cards are kept. To deal cards to begin a new round, the player clicks in this area, which causes 10 cards to be dealt face-up into the tableau, one into each column. However, for a deal to succeed, there must be at least one card in every column.

### The foundation

The foundation is where assembled suits are displayed. While this area is not technically necessary, it helps the player keep track of their progress.
